TermA (Terminal Adventure) is a text-based Python game set in a futuristic world where players navigate through challenging levels, solve puzzles, and interact with a variety of characters. The game is designed to be a fun and engaging experience for fans of old-school terminal-based adventures, offering a nostalgic dive into the text gaming world while integrating modern features.

This repository contains the core files for TermA, including the gameplay logic, puzzle mechanics, and other interactive elements. The game is currently in early development, with many features planned for future releases. You can follow the development process on YouTube at [thecherno.com/game](https://thecherno.com/game).

## The Plan
TermA is being developed as a fun, interactive, and educational experience. The aim is to combine classic text-based adventure gameplay with a modern coding structure that will help aspiring developers learn the basics of Python while playing through an engaging story.

### Main features to come:
- Procedurally generated levels
- An evolving storyline with multiple choices and endings
- Interactive NPCs (non-playable characters)
- Complex puzzles requiring logical thinking
- A dynamic inventory system
- A combat system (with a text-based interface)
- Audio cues for certain events (planned for later)
- Possible expansion into other text-based worlds

## Short term goals:
*Note: This is subject to change! Stay updated on the roadmap at [terma.com/roadmap](http://terma.com/roadmap).*

By the end of 2025, we aim to complete the following milestones:

- Finalize the first set of levels with unique challenges.
- Introduce basic NPC interactions with dialogues.
- Create a more immersive and dynamic world by incorporating various environments and quests.
- Implement save/load functionality so players can track their progress.
- Allow users to contribute additional levels and puzzles to the game.
  
With these updates, TermA will become an even more robust and interactive experience.
